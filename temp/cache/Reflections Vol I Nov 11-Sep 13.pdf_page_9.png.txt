retelling of "The High Lobo" without the alien connotations. "Snow in August" also by Pete Hamill takes place in 1947 and follows the life of eleven-year-old Michael Devlin, who is Irish-American. The story is about the friendship between Michael and Rabbi Judah Hirsch, a refugee from Prague. Here in Brooklyn, surrounded by tenements and the smell of hotdogs, Rabbi Hirsch enchants Michael with stories of ancient wisdom as Michael explains to him the equally wondrous world of baseball. The neighborhood intervenes - and the only thing that can save them from the hate all around them is a miracle. Both great books reminiscent of John Grisham's "Painted House."

So why am I writing this? Well, I hope and wish Lawrence and Courtney will see this one day. I realize that quite possibly no one will read it, but I hope Lauren will somehow find this and read it one day. I am fearful that the future doesn't seem so bright for me or other incarcerated persons. I was listening to the Glenn Beck radio show yesterday when he played a manifesto of the hacker group "Anonymous" in its entirety which included the promise of "deleting all of the data on Wall Street" on Mon, Oct 10. Pretty lofty threat. Maybe they succeed, maybe they don't. All I can say is that from what I can observe, it looks like the shit is about to hit the fan. So until it does, I intend to write in my journals which I have entitled "Reflections collected for an audience of one, the most amazing person in the world," Lawrence and Courtney. In part I am being selfish because everyone would like to be remembered. In another, I want to share with you who I am. A journal seems to be the best vehicle for this, as your mother is preventing our communicating, irrationally, I believe. For the record, the only reason you have not heard from me or seen me since May 14, 2009, is because your mother prevented you. Doing so. No other reason. Well I stayed in 4000 for the rooming reason. Other reasons include, seeing my other piece of shit X do nothing relatives who although knowing the means ...

... and the desire for your well-being pussyfooted around and did nothing, while they should have acted). But first and foremost, the #1 reason you haven't seen me or heard from me is Ant Michelle aka Norton, Courtney Woods. Am I bitter? Seems a bit. I refuse to believe you don't love me or care about me. I believe you are in a bad situation. It takes a considerable amount of effort and ingenuity to connect a pen to paper, put it in an envelope, put an address on that envelope, put a stamp on that envelope, and then deposit that envelope in a mailbox. You may recall the number of times the electricity or water were cut off at the house. The only reason why that happened was I was incapable of such superhuman feats as putting ink on a check, putting the check in an envelope, putting an address on the envelope, and putting a stamp on that envelope and putting it in the mail.

I wrote you seven separate letters from March to July. (In August, I asked my buddy to have his wife find out what was going on, specifically why you hadn't heard from your mother. See I spoke to Patia in January when I was in Texas (a story for another day) and at that time she told me that she still loves me and thought about me every day (several times). So of course, I still love your mom and always will, but that doesn't mean I can't be really pissed at her for being such a bitch! Speaking of, love, the opposite of love is INDIFFERENCE. Hate and love are intertwined. So some days I feel like I hate your mom, you can think of hate in that context, as I have Anger, Betrayal (your mom betrayed me three times), and I have forgiven her. Even in my last letter, I stated simply that. I will always love both of you. And of course, this whole situation sucks for you. I mean that I am sorry, a thousand times. But I can honestly say I never thought in a million years I would end up ripped from ...

... life like I have been. As Amy Ellson always used to say, "Fair is a place where you ride the rides." This whole goddamn situation hasn't been fair. I'm sorry. So anyway, my buddy's wife called I think in August or so, and she was verbally assaulted by your loving mother to step the fuck off. So it has been nothing else to say to your mom that has any effectiveness all (she at least visits me although she has done nothing else), to say to your mom that "she could go fuck herself for all I care". So anyway, I was reading the Oct 3 Time Magazine when I happened upon an article about (guess who) Tea Partiers decrying the horrid state of a society that would actually pay Disability Benefits (SSD Social Security Disability) to families with children diagnosed as ADD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder)...

As I wrote in the letter to your mom who cares whether ADHD exists or not, money is money man. Times are tough and if you can get more money from our tyrannical government then do it!

Well I have burned up nearly four pages of this Reflection and I haven't even scratched the surface. Lauren, I think of you many times every day. I will always love you and I am proud of you. And? I miss you so damn much and wish I could see you and hear from you. Well I'm just got a 21 page Initial Brief to work on. Talk to you soon.

Well I finally got the book "Firstborn" by A.C. Clarke & Stephen Baxter today. As it turns out, Firstborn is the last book of the Time Odyssey trilogy. From the book's cover, their first act into the Discontinuity in which Earth was carved into sections from different eras of history, nestled into a patchwork land by ominent "Mins". (This is inhabitants included such notables as Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, and United Nations peacekeeper Bisesa Dutt). For reasons unknown to her, Bisesa entered into communication with an alien artifact of inscrutable purpose and godlike power that eventually returned her to Earth. There, she played an inevitable role in humanity's race against ...

... Firstborn designs to eradicate all life from the planet. That fate was averted at an inconceivable price. Now, 27 yrs later, the Firstborn are back. This time, they aren't pulling punches, they have sent a "quantum" bomb speeding towards Earth. It is a device that human scientists can barely comprehend that cannot be stopped or destroyed—a chain that will obliterate the world.) Bisesa's desperate quest for answers sends her first to Mars and then to Mir, which is itself threatened with extinction. The end seems inevitable, but as shocking new insights emerge into the nature of the Firstborn and their chilling plans for mankind, an unexpected ally appears from light years away.

Well that was quite the mouthful. Sometimes the best way to explain something as complicated as a SciFi Space Opera trilogy is its own book jacket from the third book of the trilogy no less.

I am using an Office Depot generic pen to write this. It is the second of four identical pens I have been given each month since working in the library. I was devastated when I lost the first but quite relieved when I got the same one with no caps about a week later. Then I eventually got the two more which I fortunately haven't lost yet. I use the 2nd OD pen so much I splintered its plastic tip so I put the 2nd's disposable ink assembly into the 3rd (or 4th?) From what I understand this will be the last month of the OD pens, then we will get BTC pens with bigger points. I'll probably find someone to sell me one of these OD pens because I like the fine point which lets me write so tiny. It sure is nice to have this notebook (193 pages left to fill, hopefully with substantially more interesting information).

These class days are very productive today! My instructor Humberto Romeo Perez (a.k.a Maestro) has been down for 7 of a 15 yr sentence only, gets out in March of 2018 two yrs or so after yoni? I just call him Maestro for short! Maestro is a Mexican doctor,  OB/GYN and he says a "surgeon", and was a chess grandmaster at age 12 or so in Cuba. Maestro has been a good friend since last November when I arrived at Martin. Today’s game focused on the Sicilian Defense 1 e4 c5 and I believe I learned quite a few new principles (principles?) not previously known. One principle even is something known as Opposition, wherein if you and your opponent 5?' say your opponent's down to a single pawn unless your opponent's King is on the sixth rank ahead of his pawn, the game will always end in a stalemate if the King is always moved mirroring the opponent's King. Opposition. Other principles covered today > Never move same piece 2x in opening. Opening is defined as the development of every back rank piece to its best possible position, most of the time aiming to center. Rook opposite castle is said to be developed when it is opposite its partner. Anyway, enough on Chess principles or principles and more on Maestro. Maestro is one of the most fascinating and interesting of my fellow inmates. I am pretty sure he is on the level about his previous life in that at least with his Chess skills he tells no lies. I have watched him play the two highest-ranked players on the compound simultaneously by beating them both! Maestro also confided in me today that at one point he also had a weight problem and just prior to his own incarceration, he weighed 375 lbs. (65 lbs more than yours truly in 2006). (Maestro grew up in Cuba of 100% European Spanish stock and is the descendant of a semi-aristocratic line of concert musicians. In any event, it is nice having friends like him because it makes the time much more bearable).

Time in prison is actually quite easy always said. While I was aboard the USS Baton Rouge SSN 689 Submarine and that prison would be much easier, never dreaming I would be unfortunate enough to find out! Well, it's true! Prison is easier, less stress. Let's see, in the Navy I had to go to sea. While at sea, I had to serve watch 8 to 12 hours a day (Field Day) every Friday at sea a perfect scrub in the galley. 14 hrs a day]. 6 1/2 days a week on average. The only things that suck today about ...
