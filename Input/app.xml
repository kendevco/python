Her short pieces are published in several markets including EveryDay Fiction, Thunder on the Battlefield and White Cat Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alex&amp;rsquo;s work is smart, dark, adventurous, and a little funny, with a emphasis on great characters and interesting worlds. She gets her inspiration from history (she majored with a European history focus in college), family members, and headlines, as well as whatever book she has in her hand. Lately she&amp;rsquo;s been reading neuroscience books; the brain&amp;rsquo;s a cool, cool place and the mind even more so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An avid cook and foodie, Alex loves great food of any stripe &amp;ndash; even better if she can figure out how to put it together. Great food is like a great book; it has lots of layers that work together beautifully, and the result is delicious and harmonious. She&amp;rsquo;s working on figuring out Indian food right now &amp;ndash; suggestions welcome!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alex loves swing dancing, tetris, music of all kinds, and has been known to get into long conversations with total strangers at restaurants about the Food Network, much to the embarrassment of her sister.

His father, General Thomas-Alexandre Dumas Davy de la Pailleterie, was born in the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti) to Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie, a French nobleman, and Marie-Cessette Dumas, a black slave. At age 14 Thomas-Alexandre was taken by his father to France, where he was educated in a military academy and entered the military for what became an illustrious career.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dumas's father's aristocratic rank helped young Alexandre Dumas acquire work with Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orl&amp;eacute;ans, then as a writer, finding early success. He became one of the leading authors of the French Romantic Movement, in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

But science fiction was his first love, so he eventually ditched journalism and began producing that which had made him decide to become a writer in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Steele has published eighteen novels and nearly one hundred short stories. His work has received numerous accolades, including three Hugo Awards, and has been translated worldwide, mainly into languages he can&amp;rsquo;t read. He serves on the board of advisors for the Space Frontier Foundation and is a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. He also belongs to Sigma, a group of science fiction writers who frequently serve as unpaid consultants on matters regarding technology and security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Allen Steele is a lifelong space buff, and this interest has not only influenced his writing, it has taken him to some interesting places. He has witnessed numerous space shuttle launches from Kennedy Space Center and has flown NASA&amp;rsquo;s shuttle cockpit simulator at the Johnson Space Center. In 2001, he testified before the US House of Representatives in hearings regarding the future of space exploration. He would like very much to go into orbit, and hopes that one day he&amp;rsquo;ll be able to afford to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Steele lives in western Massachusetts with his wife, Linda, and a continual procession of adopted dogs. He collects vintage science fiction books and magazines, spacecraft model kits, and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

In that same year he married Barbara Berson Rose.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bova was an avid fencer and organized Avco Everett's fencing club. He was an environmentalist, but rejected Luddism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bova was a technical writer for Project Vanguard and later for Avco Everett in the 1960s when they did research in lasers and fluid dynamics. It was there that he met Arthur R. Kantrowitz later of the Foresight Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1971 he became editor of Analog Science Fiction after John W. Campbell's death. After leaving Analog, he went on to edit Omni during 1978-1982.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1974 he wrote the screenplay for an episode of the children's science fiction television series Land of the Lost entitled &quot;The Search&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bova was the science advisor for the failed television series The Starlost, leaving in disgust after the airing of the first episode. His novel The Starcrossed was loosely based on his experiences and featured a thinly veiled characterization of his friend and colleague Harlan Ellison.

In 2000, he was the Author Guest of Honor at the 58th World Science Fiction Convention (Chicon 2000).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hollywood has started to take an interest in Bova's works once again, in addition to his wealth of knowledge about science and what the future may look like.

      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;Written in stolen moments under truck chassis and on park benches to a soundtrack of The Downward Spiral and Pablo Honey, Fight Club came into existence. The adaptation of Fight Club was a flop at the box office, but achieved cult status on DVD. The film&amp;rsquo;s popularity drove sales of the novel. Chuck put out two novels in 1999, Survivor and Invisible Monsters. Choke, published in 2001, became Chuck&amp;rsquo;s first New York Times bestseller. Chuck&amp;rsquo;s work has always been infused with personal experience, and his next novel, Lullaby, was no exception. Chuck credits writing Lullaby with helping him cope with the tragic death of his father. Diary and the non-fiction guide to Portland, Fugitives and Refugees, were released in 2003. While on the road in support of Diary, Chuck began reading a short story entitled 'Guts,' which would eventually become part of the novel Haunted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed, he continued to write, publishing the bestselling Rant, Snuff, Pygmy, Tell-All, a 'remix' of Invisible Monsters, Damned, and most recently, Doomed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chuck also enjoys giving back to his fans, and teaching the art of storytelling has been an important part of that. In 2004, Chuck began submitting essays to ChuckPalahniuk.net on the craft of writing. These were 'How To' pieces, straight out of Chuck's personal bag of tricks, based on the tenants of minimalism he learned from Tom Spanbauer. Every month, a &amp;ldquo;Homework Assignment&amp;rdquo; would accompany the lesson, so Workshop members could apply what they had learned. (all 36 of these essays can currently be found on The Cult's sister-site, LitReactor.com).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2009, Chuck increased his involvement by committing to read and review a selection of fan-written stories each month. The best stories are currently set to be published in Burnt Tongues, a forthcoming anthology, with an introduction written by Chuck himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His next novel, Beautiful You, is due out in October 2014.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;Clive Barker was born in Liverpool, England, the son of Joan Rubie (n&amp;eacute;e Revill), a painter and school welfare officer, and Leonard Barker, a personnel director for an industrial relations firm. Educated at Dovedale Primary School and Quarry Bank High School, he studied English and Philosophy at Liverpool University and his picture now hangs in the entrance hallway to the Philosophy Department. It was in Liverpool in 1975 that he met his first partner, John Gregson, with whom he lived until 1986. Barker's second long-term relationship, with photographer David Armstrong, ended in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Clive Barker received The Davidson/Valentini Award at the 15th GLAAD Media Awards. This award is presented &quot;to an openly lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender individual who has made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for any of those communities&quot;. While Barker is critical of organized religion, he has stated that he is a believer in both God and the afterlife, and that the Bible influences his work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fans have noticed of late that Barker's voice has become gravelly and coarse. He says in a December 2008 online interview that this is due to polyps in his throat which were so severe that a doctor told him he was taking in ten percent of the air he was supposed to have been getting. He has had two surgeries to remove them and believes his resultant voice is an improvement over how it was prior to the surgeries. He said he did not have cancer and has given up cigars. On August 27, 2010, Barker underwent surgery yet again to remove new polyp growths from his throat. In early February 2012 Barker fell into a coma after a dentist visit led to blood poisoning. Barker remained in a coma for eleven days but eventually came out of it. Fans were notified on his Twitter page about some of the experience and that Barker was recovering after the ordeal, but left with many strange visions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Barker is one of the leading authors of contemporary horror/fantasy, writing in the horror genre early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in Books of Blood 1 &amp;ndash; 6), and the Faustian novel The Damnation Game (1985). Later he moved towards modern-day fantasy and urban fantasy with horror elements in Weaveworld (1987), The Great and Secret Show (1989), the world-spanning Imajica (1991) and Sacrament (1996), bringing in the deeper, richer concepts of reality, the nature of the mind and dreams, and the power of words and memories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Barker has a keen interest in movie production, although his films have received mixed receptions. He wrote the screenplays for Underworld (aka Transmutations &amp;ndash; 1985) and Rawhead Rex (1986), both directed by George Pavlou. Displeased by how his material was handled, he moved to directing with Hellraiser (1987), based on his novella The Hellbound Heart. His early movies, the shorts The Forbidden and Salome, are experimental art movies with surrealist elements, which have been re-released together to moderate critical acclaim. After his film Nightbreed (Cabal), which was widely considered to be a flop, Barker returned to write and direct Lord of Illusions. Barker was an executive producer of the film Gods and Monsters, which received major critical acclaim.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Barker is a prolific visual artist working in a variety of media, often illustrating his own books. His paintings have been seen first on the covers of his official fan club magazine, Dread, published by Fantaco in the early Nineties, as well on the covers of the collections of his plays, Incarnations (1995) and Forms of Heaven (1996), as well as on the second printing of the original UK publications of his Books of Blood series.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A longtime comics fan, Barker achieved his dream of publishing his own superhero books when Marvel Comics launched the Razorline imprint in 1993. Based on detailed premises, titles and lead characters he created specifically for this, the four interrelated titles &amp;mdash; set outside the Marvel universe &amp;mdash; were Ectokid&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

Several of his novels have sold translation rights to Germany, Greece, and Romania. He also publishes quite actively in the small-press/limited-edition hardcover market; many of his books in this category have become collector's items.

      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American author and journalist. His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short story collections and two non-fiction works. Three novels, four collections of short stories and three non-fiction works were published posthumously. Many of these are considered classics of American literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois, and after high school he reported for a few months for The Kansas City Star, before leaving for the Italian front to enlist with the World War I ambulance drivers. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms. In 1922, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of his four wives. The couple moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent, and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s &quot;Lost Generation&quot; expatriate community. The Sun Also Rises, Hemingway's first novel, was published in 1926.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After his 1927 divorce from Hadley Richardson, Hemingway married Pauline Pfeiffer. They divorced after he returned from Spanish Civil War where he had acted as a journalist, and after which he wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls. Martha Gellhorn became his third wife in 1940. They separated when he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II; during which he was present at the Normandy Landings and liberation of Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the publication of The Old Man and the Sea in 1952, Hemingway went on safari to Africa, where he was almost killed in two plane crashes that left him in pain and ill-health for much of the rest of his life. Hemingway had permanent residences in Key West, Florida, and Cuba during the 1930s and 1940s, but in 1959 he moved from Cuba to Ketchum, Idaho, where he committed suicide in the summer of 1961&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

After graduating from high school, he began playing banjo with a local bluegrass group. He and his wife were married in 1972, and Peretti soon moved from touring with a pop band to launching a modest Christian music ministry. Peretti later spent time studying English, screen writing and film at UCLA and then assisted his father in pastoring a small Assembly of God church. In 1983, he gave up his pastoring position and began taking construction jobs to make ends meet. While working at a local ski factory, he began writing This Present Darkness, the book that would catapult him into the public eye. After numerous rejections from publishers and a slow start in sales, word-of-mouth enthusiasm finally lifted This Present Darkness onto a tidal wave of interest in spiritual warfare. The book appeared on Bookstore Journal&amp;rsquo;s bestseller list every month for more than eight years. Peretti&amp;rsquo;s two spiritual warfare novels, This Present Darkness (1998) and Piercing the Darkness (1989), captivated readers, together selling more than 3.5 million copies. The Oath was awarded the 1996 Gold Medallion Award for best fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For kids, Peretti wrote The Cooper Kids Adventure Series (Crossways and Tommy Nelson), which remains a best-selling series for children with sales exceeding 1 million copies. In August 2000, Peretti released the hilarious children&amp;rsquo;s audiocassette series titled Wild and Wacky Totally True Bible Stories, reprising his role as Mr. Henry, the offbeat substitute Sunday School teacher found in two Visual Bible for Kids videos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Peretti released his first-ever non-fiction book, The Wounded Spirit in 2000, which quickly became a best-seller. The book addresses the pain of &amp;ldquo;wounded spirits&amp;rdquo; and was writted as a result of painful childhood experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Frank Peretti and his wife, Barbara Jean, live in the Western U.S. In spite of sudden fame and notoriety, Frank still lives a simple, well-rounded life that includes carpentry, banjo making, sculpturing, bicycling and hiking. He is also an avid pilot.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;Glenn Meade was born into a working-class family in Dublin, Ireland. After finishing secondary school he had a tough time choosing between studying theology or engineering, but eventually engineering won out and he studied telecommunications. Soon after graduating, he lived and worked in New Hampshire. He worked as a specialist in the field of pilot training&amp;mdash;having had a life-long interest in aviation&amp;mdash;and has also been a journalist for the Irish Times and the Independent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While living in New Hampshire, he persistently tried to interview the famously reclusive author of CATCHER IN THE RYE, J.D. Salinger, an effort that only served to vex Salinger, who set his dogs on Meade, who luckily managed to outrun Salinger&amp;rsquo;s hounds and survive.&lt;br /&gt;He began writing in earnest in the late eighties, when he wrote and directed his own plays, mostly for the Strand Theatre in Dublin, but Meade decided to turn his efforts to thriller writing in the mid-nineties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His novels to date&amp;mdash;SNOW WOLF, BRANDENBURG, THE SANDS OF SAKKARA, RESURRECTION DAY, WEB OF DECEIT, THE DEVIL&amp;rsquo;S DISCIPLE, THE SECOND MESSIAH&amp;mdash;have been translated into twenty-six languages, and have enjoyed critical and commercial success.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His first novel, BRANDENBURG, about a neo-Nazi resurgence in present-day Europe, came about when he travelled to Germany to write an article for the Times on the billions in Nazi gold that went missing at the end of the Second World War. Quite by accident, he met an elderly former SS officer who told him a remarkable and highly personal tale about his part in keeping a disturbing war-time secret. That story became the inspiration for BRANDENBURG.&lt;br /&gt;Several of his novels were also inspired by his journalistic work but inspiration only takes you so far and Meade claims that to produce anything of worth it always comes down to the same three constants: hard work, prayer, and putting your imagination through the wringer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Critics have compared the standard of his work to that of Frederick Forsyth, John le Carre, and Tom Clancy, and his stories have tended to be a tantalising blend of fact and fiction. SNOW WOLF won the prestigious thriller of the year award by the Japanese Writer's Guild (second place went to Stephen King's THE GREEN MILE).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He has also worked on several Hollywood scripts but Meade confesses that employment in Tinsletown was not a pleasant experience and he has learned to stick to the golden rule for novelists whose work is bought by Hollywood&amp;mdash;gratefully accept the pay check, walk away and just pray that they don&amp;rsquo;t turn your treasured story into a musical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meade has earned a reputation for meticulously researched stories and has travelled extensively&amp;mdash;to Russia, the Middle East, Europe&amp;mdash;to research his novels. For RESURRECTION DAY, a highly realistic thriller about a dramatic attack on the US capital by an Al Qaeda terror group armed with a chemical weapon of mass destruction, and completed three weeks before the events of September 11th, he spent many months in Washington DC. He interviewed senior White House staff, former Secret Service agents, US Federal emergency planners, and senior FBI terrorist experts, some of whom were later involved in the hunt for Al Qaeda terrorist suspects on US soil. One former senior FBI source, John O&amp;rsquo;Neill, who helped Meade, was killed in the September 11th attacks, having resigned from the bureau only months prior to taking up a new post&amp;mdash;as head of security at the Twin Towers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;RESURRECTION DAY was published internationally but Meade&amp;rsquo;s then New York publisher considered it too raw a subject for the US, coming so soon after 9/11, and they parted company. However, the work garnered rave reviews and much media attention in Europe.&lt;br /&gt;Having read the book, Newt Gingrich, then a member of the Hart-Rudd commission (set up post 9/11 by President George Bush with responsibility for determining future likely terrorist threats against the US) was so impressed that he contacted Meade&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

His work has been described as 'easily accessible, yet profoundly complex'. He can be located on Facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/harukimuraka...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since childhood, Murakami has been heavily influenced by Western culture, particularly Western music and literature. He grew up reading a range of works by American writers, such as Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan, and he is often distinguished from other Japanese writers by his Western influences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Murakami studied drama at Waseda University in Tokyo, where he met his wife, Yoko. His first job was at a record store, which is where one of his main characters, Toru Watanabe in Norwegian Wood, works. Shortly before finishing his studies, Murakami opened the coffeehouse 'Peter Cat' which was a jazz bar in the evening in Kokubunji, Tokyo with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of his novels have themes and titles that invoke classical music, such as the three books making up The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: The Thieving Magpie (after Rossini's opera), Bird as Prophet (after a piano piece by Robert Schumann usually known in English as The Prophet Bird), and The Bird-Catcher (a character in Mozart's opera The Magic Flute). Some of his novels take their titles from songs: Dance, Dance, Dance (after The Dells' song, although it is widely thought it was titled after the Beach Boys tune), Norwegian Wood (after The Beatles' song) and South of the Border, West of the Sun (the first part being the title of a song by Nat King Cole).&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;Iain M. Banks is a pseudonym of Iain Banks which he used to publish his Science Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Banks's father was an officer in the Admiralty and his mother was once a professional ice skater. Iain Banks was educated at the University of Stirling where he studied English Literature, Philosophy and Psychology. He moved to London and lived in the south of England until 1988 when he returned to Scotland, living in Edinburgh and then Fife.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Banks met his wife Annie in London, before the release of his first book. They married in Hawaii in 1992. However, he announced in early 2007 that, after 25 years together, they had separated. He lived most recently in North Queensferry, a town on the north side of the Firth of Forth near the Forth Bridge and the Forth Road Bridge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As with his friend Ken MacLeod (another Scottish writer of technical and social science fiction) a strong awareness of left-wing history shows in his writings. The argument that an economy of abundance renders anarchy and adhocracy viable (or even inevitable) attracts many as an interesting potential experiment, were it ever to become testable. He was a signatory to the Declaration of Calton Hill, which calls for Scottish independence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In late 2004, Banks was a prominent member of a group of British politicians and media figures who campaigned to have Prime Minister Tony Blair impeached following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In protest he cut up his passport and posted it to 10 Downing Street. In an interview in Socialist Review he claimed he did this after he &quot;abandoned the idea of crashing my Land Rover through the gates of Fife dockyard, after spotting the guys armed with machine guns.&quot; He related his concerns about the invasion of Iraq in his book Raw Spirit, and the principal protagonist (Alban McGill) in the novel The Steep Approach to Garbadale confronts another character with arguments in a similar vein.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interviewed on Mark Lawson's BBC Four series, first broadcast in the UK on 14 November 2006, Banks explained why his novels are published under two different names. His parents wished to name him Iain Menzies Banks but his father made a mistake when registering the birth and he was officially registered as Iain Banks. Despite this he continued to use his unofficial middle name and it was as Iain M. Banks that he submitted The Wasp Factory for publication. However, his editor asked if he would mind dropping the 'M' as it appeared &quot;too fussy&quot;. The editor was also concerned about possible confusion with Rosie M. Banks, a minor character in some of P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves novels who is a romantic novelist. After his first three mainstream novels his publishers agreed to publish his first SF novel, Consider Phlebas. To distinguish between the mainstream and SF novels, Banks suggested the return of the 'M', although at one stage he considered John B. Macallan as his SF pseudonym, the name deriving from his favourite whiskies: Johnnie Walker Black Label and The Macallan single malt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His latest book was a science fiction (SF) novel in the Culture series, called The Hydrogen Sonata, published in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Author Iain M. Banks revealed in April 2013 that he had late-stage cancer. He died the following June.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Scottish writer posted a message on his official website saying his next novel The Quarry, due to be published later this year*, would be his last.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;See also: Robert Galbraith&lt;br /&gt;Although she writes under the pen name J.K. Rowling, pronounced like rolling, her name when her first Harry Potter book was published was simply Joanne Rowling. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers demanded that she use two initials, rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose K as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother Kathleen Ada Bulgen Rowling. She calls herself Jo and has said, &quot;No one ever called me 'Joanne' when I was young, unless they were angry.&quot; Following her marriage, she has sometimes used the name Joanne Murray when conducting personal business. During the Leveson Inquiry she gave evidence under the name of Joanne Kathleen Rowling. In a 2012 interview, Rowling noted that she no longer cared that people pronounced her name incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rowling was born to Peter James Rowling, a Rolls-Royce aircraft engineer, and Anne Rowling (n&amp;eacute;e Volant), on 31 July 1965 in Yate, Gloucestershire, England, 10 miles (16 km) northeast of Bristol. Her mother Anne was half-French and half-Scottish. Her parents first met on a train departing from King's Cross Station bound for Arbroath in 1964. They married on 14 March 1965. Her mother's maternal grandfather, Dugald Campbell, was born in Lamlash on the Isle of Arran. Her mother's paternal grandfather, Louis Volant, was awarded the Croix de Guerre for exceptional bravery in defending the village of Courcelles-le-Comte during the First World War.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rowling's sister Dianne was born at their home when Rowling was 23 months old. The family moved to the nearby village Winterbourne when Rowling was four. She attended St Michael's Primary School, a school founded by abolitionist William Wilberforce and education reformer Hannah More. Her headmaster at St Michael's, Alfred Dunn, has been suggested as the inspiration for the Harry Potter headmaster Albus Dumbledore.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a child, Rowling often wrote fantasy stories, which she would usually then read to her sister. She recalls that: &quot;I can still remember me telling her a story in which she fell down a rabbit hole and was fed strawberries by the rabbit family inside it. Certainly the first story I ever wrote down (when I was five or six) was about a rabbit called Rabbit. He got the measles and was visited by his friends, including a giant bee called Miss Bee.&quot; At the age of nine, Rowling moved to Church Cottage in the Gloucestershire village of Tutshill, close to Chepstow, Wales. When she was a young teenager, her great aunt, who Rowling said &quot;taught classics and approved of a thirst for knowledge, even of a questionable kind,&quot; gave her a very old copy of Jessica Mitford's autobiography, Hons and Rebels. Mitford became Rowling's heroine, and Rowling subsequently read all of her books.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rowling has said of her teenage years, in an interview with The New Yorker, &quot;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly happy. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a dreadful time of life.&quot; She had a difficult homelife; her mother was ill and she had a difficult relationship with her father (she is no longer on speaking terms with him). She attended secondary school at Wyedean School and College, where her mother had worked as a technician in the science department. Rowling said of her adolescence, &quot;Hermione [a bookish, know-it-all Harry Potter character] is loosely based on me. She's a caricature of me when I was eleven, which I'm not particularly proud of.&quot; Steve Eddy, who taught Rowling English when she first arrived, remembers her as &quot;not exceptional&quot; but &quot;one of a group of girls who were bright, and quite good at English.&quot; Sean Harris, her best friend in the Upper Sixth owned a turquoise Ford Anglia, which she says inspired the one in her books.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

After leaving school at the age of sixteen, he worked various odd jobs until, after receiving a scholarship, he began a five-year program at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough covering the practical and theoretical sides of electrical, electronic, and mechanical engineering. He first married at the age of twenty, and he has had three other subsequent marriages and fathered six children.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hogan worked as a design engineer for several companies and eventually moved into sales in the 1960s, travelling around Europe as a sales engineer for Honeywell. In the 1970s he joined the Digital Equipment Corporation's Laboratory Data Processing Group and in 1977 moved to Boston, Massachusetts to run its sales training program. He published his first novel, Inherit the Stars, in the same year to win an office bet. He quit DEC in 1979 and began writing full time, moving to Orlando, Florida, for a year where he met his third wife Jackie. They then moved to Sonora, California.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hogan's style of science fiction is usually hard science fiction. In his earlier works he conveyed a sense of what science and scientists were about. His philosophical view on how science should be done comes through in many of his novels; theories should be formulated based on empirical research, not the other way around. If a theory does not match the facts, it is theory that should be discarded, not the facts. This is very evident in the Giants series, which begins with the discovery of a 50,000 year-old human body on the Moon. This discovery leads to a series of investigations, and as facts are discovered, theories on how the astronaut's body arrived on the Moon 50,000 years ago are elaborated, discarded, and replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hogan's fiction also reflects anti-authoritarian social views. Many of his novels have strong anarchist or libertarian themes, often promoting the idea that new technological advances render certain social conventions obsolete. For example, the effectively limitless availability of energy that would result from the development of controlled nuclear fusion would make it unnecessary to limit access to energy resources. In essence, energy would become free. This melding of scientific and social speculation is clearly present in the novel Voyage from Yesteryear (strongly influenced by Eric Frank Russell's famous story &quot;And Then There Were None&quot;), which describes the contact between a high-tech anarchist society on a planet in the Alpha Centauri system, with a starship sent from Earth by a dictatorial government. The story uses many elements of civil disobedience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;James Hogan died unexpectedly from a heart attack at his home in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

He attended Grosse Pointe's private University Liggett School. He took his undergraduate degree at Brown University, graduating in 1983. He later earned an M.A. in Creative Writing from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1986 he received the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Nicholl Fellowship for his story &quot;Here Comes Winston, Full of the Holy Spirit&quot;. His 1993 novel, The Virgin Suicides, gained mainstream interest with the 1999 film adaptation directed by Sofia Coppola. The novel was reissued in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eugenides is reluctant to appear in public or disclose details about his private life, except through Michigan-area book signings in which he details the influence of Detroit and his high-school experiences on his writings. He has said that he has been haunted by the decline of Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Eugenides lives in Princeton, New Jersey, with his wife, the photographer and sculptor Karen Yamauchi, and their daughter. In the fall of 2007, Eugenides joined the faculty of Princeton University's Program in Creative Writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His 2002 novel, Middlesex, won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction and the Ambassador Book Award. Part of it was set in Berlin, Germany, where Eugenides lived from 1999 to 2004, but it was chiefly concerned with the Greek-American immigrant experience in the United States, against the rise and fall of Detroit. It explores the experience of the intersexed in the USA. Eugenides has also published short stories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eugenides is the editor of the collection of short stories titled My Mistress's Sparrow is Dead. The proceeds of the collection go to the writing center 826 Chicago, established to encourage young people's writing.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

In 1986, he and two other reporters spent several months interviewing survivors of a major airline crash. They wrote a magazine story on the crash and the survivors which was later short-listed for the Pulitzer Prize for feature writing.

      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;Michel Onfray is a French philosopher. Born to a family of Norman farmers, he graduated with a Ph.D. in philosophy. He taught this subject to senior students at a technical high school in Caen between 1983 and 2002, before establishing what he and his supporters call the Universit&amp;eacute; populaire de Caen, proclaiming its foundation on a free-of-charge basis, and the manifesto written by Onfray in 2004 (La communaut&amp;eacute; philosophique). However, the title 'Popular University' is misleading, although attractive, as this 'University' provides no services other than the occasional delivery of lectures - there is no register of students, no examination or assessment, and no diplomas. After all, 'ordinary' French University lectures are open to all, free of charge. Nor is the content of the Universit&amp;eacute; populaire de Caen radical in French terms, it is in its way, a throwback to less democratic traditions of learning. Both in his writing and his lecturing, Onfray's approach is hierarchical, and elitist. He prefers to say though that his 'university' is committed to deliver high-level knowledge to the masses, as opposed to the more common approach of vulgarizing philosophic concepts through easy-to-read books such as &quot;Philosophy for Well-being&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Onfray writes obscurely that there is no philosophy without psychoanalysis. Perhaps paradoxically, he proclaims himself as an adamant atheist (something more novel in France than elsewhere - indeed his book, 'Atheist Manifesto', was briefly in the 'bestsellers' list in France) and he considers religion to be indefensible. He instead regards himself as being part of the tradition of individualist anarchism, a tradition that he claims is at work throughout the entire history of philosophy and that he is seeking to revive amidst modern schools of philosophy that he feels are cynical and epicurean. His writings celebrate hedonism, reason and atheism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He endorsed the French Revolutionary Communist League and its candidate for the French presidency, Olivier Besancenot in the 2002 election, although this is somewhat at odds with the libertarian socialism he advocates in his writings.[citation needed] In 2007, he endorsed Jos&amp;eacute; Bov&amp;eacute; - but eventually voted for Olivier Besancenot - , and conducted an interview with the future French President, who he declared was an 'ideological enemy' Nicolas Sarkozy for Philosophie Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

After a long battle with the English educational system which involved avoiding school whenever possible he was offered a place to read English at New College, Oxford when no other university would interview him. After graduating he worked in over twenty different jobs, including boardman in a betting shop, messenger boy to a City merchant bank and teacher. He was also senior film censor at the British Board of Film Classification.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His first novel, The Wisdom of Crocodiles took thirteen years to write. Among other things it predicted the re-emergence of international terrorism in the 21st Century and the precise nature of the collapse of the world financial system. Part of the novel was made into a film starring Jude Law and Timothy Spall. His second novel, The Golden Age of Censorship, a black comedy based on his experiences as a film censor, was published in 2007.

The seventh edition of the book, published in 1999, included a new final chapter entitled &quot;The End of Worldly Philosophy?&quot;, which included both a grim view on the current state of economics as well as a hopeful vision for a &quot;reborn worldly philosophy&quot; that incorporated social aspects of capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although a highly unconventional economist, who regarded himself as more of a social theorist and &quot;worldly philosopher&quot; (philosopher pre-occupied with &quot;worldly&quot; affairs, such as economic structures), and who tended to integrate the disciplines of history, economics and philosophy, Heilbroner was nevertheless recognized by his peers as a prominent economist. He was elected Vice President of the American Economic Association in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He also came up with a way of classifying economies, as either Traditional (primarily agriculturally-based, perhaps subsistence economy), Command (centrally planned economy, often involving the state), Market (capitalism), or Mixed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Heilbroner died on January 4, 2005 in New York, NY at the age of 85&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;Robert J. Sawyer is one of Canada's best known and most successful science fiction writers. He is the only Canadian (and one of only 7 writers in the world) to have won all three of the top international awards for science fiction: the 1995 Nebula Award for The Terminal Experiment, the 2003 Hugo Award for Hominids, and the 2006 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Mindscan.&lt;br /&gt;Robert Sawyer grew up in Toronto, the son of two university professors. He credits two of his favourite shows from the late 1960s and early 1970s, Search and Star Trek, with teaching him some of the fundamentals of the science-fiction craft. Sawyer was obsessed with outer space from a young age, and he vividly remembers watching the televised Apollo missions. He claims to have watched the 1968 classic film 2001: A Space Odyssey 25 times. He began writing science fiction in a high school club, which he co-founded, NASFA (Northview Academy Association of Science Fiction Addicts). Sawyer graduated in 1982 from the Radio and Television Arts Program at Ryerson University, where he later worked as an instructor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sawyer's first published book, Golden Fleece (1989), is an adaptation of short stories that had previously appeared in the science-fiction magazine Amazing Stories. This book won the Aurora Award for the best Canadian science-fiction novel in English. In the early 1990s Sawyer went on to publish his inventive Quintaglio Ascension trilogy, about a world of intelligent dinosaurs. His 1995 award winning The Terminal Experiment confirmed his place as a major international science-fiction writer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A prolific writer, Sawyer has published more than 10 novels, plus two trilogies. Reviewers praise Sawyer for his concise prose, which has been compared to that of the science-fiction master Isaac Asimov. Like many science fiction-writers, Sawyer welcomes the opportunities his chosen genre provides for exploring ideas. The first book of his Neanderthal Parallax trilogy, Hominids (2002), is set in a near-future society, in which a quantum computing experiment brings a Neanderthal scientist from a parallel Earth to ours. His 2006 Mindscan explores the possibility of transferring human consciousness into a mechanical body, and the ensuing ethical, legal, and societal ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A passionate advocate for science fiction, Sawyer teaches creative writing and appears frequently in the media to discuss his genre. He prefers the label &quot;philosophical fiction,&quot; and in no way sees himself as a predictor of the future. His mission statement for his writing is &quot;To combine the intimately human with the grandly cosmic.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;​I was born and raised in Bryan, Texas a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started writing stories down when I was ten after one of my older sisters (thanks, Gari!) read an assignment I'd written for school and thought it was hysterical. I followed it up with lots of other stories, all of which have doubtless been reborn as wildflowers and trees after this many decades of decomposing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once I got a little adultish, I spent a few years bopping around; I lived in Austin, went to college back home, sweated out a summer doing summer stock in Seguin, TX, spent a year in Paris as an au pair, and finally moved to Los Angeles to break into the movies. The fact that you have seen me in exactly 0 movies should indicate my level of success at this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was more successful at computing, which I moved back to Texas to do and have been employed at for around a quarter century at this point. God, I'm old. Old and boring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the move back, I got together with my sweet honey​ and we had two little honeys of our own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While my wife was pregnant with our firstborn, I had the idea for a unique and colorful blog that would be a way to introduce myself to the world and become a springboard for my writing to reach a wider audience. RPGs-a-plenty hit Blogger and I was off and running!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and at the same time, I started using Blogger to make a fun little blog in which I invented alternate histories and wrote flash fictions about them in a Today-In-History format. It was mainly a writing spur and a place to make outlines and notes about projects I wanted to flesh out later. I didn't plan to do anything much with it, but I made it public and gave it a cute name, anyway - Today In Alternate History - just because I thought it was fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Naturally, people noticed the one I didn't intend to do anything with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TIAH was more successful for me than anything I'd written before or since, but it didn't exactly let me quit my day job. I handed it over to an Ascended Fan, who has, to be honest, run it better than I ever did, even if he did change my format to magazine-style.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since handing over the reins to TIAH, I've been concentrating on novels and this whole ebook thing the kids are talking about these days. I have a friend who's doing quite well at this, and I have nothing but high hopes for my own future. After all, JK Rowling is only a month older than I am.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you have a minute, ask me about the people who followed the path I blazed who are now WAY more successful than I am.

Ramaswamy Gounderis respected worldwide as one of the major pioneers of the interfaith movement and as one of the most respected Yoga Masters of our time. Sri Gurudev's teachings and spirit guide us toward a life of peace and to religious harmony among all people. Invited to come to the West in 1966, Sri Gurudev was quickly embraced by young Americans looking for lasting peace during the turbulent 1960's. In 1969, he opened the Woodstock Festival. The peaceful atmosphere that prevailed throughout the event was often attributed to his message and blessings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sri Gurudev founded and is the guiding light for Integral Yoga&amp;reg; International. Integral Yoga, as taught by Sri Gurudev, combines various methods of Yoga, including Hatha Yoga, selfless service, meditation, prayer, and a 5,000-year-old philosophy that helps one find the peace and joy within. Integral Yoga is the foundation for Dr. Dean Ornish's landmark work in reversing heart disease and Dr. Michael Lerner's noted Commonweal Cancer Help program. Today more than 50 Integral Yoga Institutes and Integral Yoga Teaching Centers throughout the United States and abroad offer classes and training programs in all aspects of Integral Yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1979, Sri Gurudev was inspired to establish Satchidananda Ashram&amp;mdash;Yogaville&amp;reg;. Based on his teachings, it is a place where people of different faiths and backgrounds can come to realize their essential oneness. Yogaville is the home of The Light Of Truth Universal Shrine (LOTUS). This unique interfaith Shrine honors the Spirit that unites all the world religions, while celebrating their diversity. People from all over the world come there to meditate and pray.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more than fifty years, Sri Gurudev sponsored interfaith worship services and conferences. His teachings advocate respecting and honoring all faiths and he was invited to share his message of peace with many world leaders and dignitaries. Over the years, Sri Gurudev received many honors for his public service. Among recent awards: the 1994 Juliet Hollister Interfaith Award presented at the United Nations and in April 2002 the prestigious U Thant Peace Award. In addition, he served on the advisory boards of many world peace and interfaith organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sri Gurudev is the author of many books, including Integral Yoga Hatha, To Know Your Self, The Living Gita, and The Golden Present. He is the subject of three biographies, Apostle of Peace, Portrait of a Modern Sage, and Boundless Giving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In August 2002, Sri Gurudev entered Mahasamadhi (a God-realized soul's conscious final exit from the body). Chidambaram, his Mahasamadhi shrine in Yogaville is open for prayer and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

To date, his work has appeared in the majority of the Short Trips collections. He has also edited three volumes in the series, The History of Christmas, Time Signature and How The Doctor Changed My Life. The second of these takes as its starting-point Guerrier's short story An Overture Too Early in The Muses. The third anthology featured stories entirely by previously unpublished writers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After contributing two stories to the anthology Life During Wartime in Big Finish's Bernice Summerfield range of books and audio dramas, Guerrier was invited to edit the subsequent year's short story collection, A Life Worth Living, and the novella collection Parallel Lives. After contributing two audio dramas to the series, Guerrier became the producer of the Bernice Summerfield range of plays and books, a post he held between January 2006 and June 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His other Doctor Who work includes the audio dramas, The Settling and The Judgement of Isskar, in Big Finish's Doctor Who audio range, three Companion Chronicles and a contribution to the UNIT spinoff series. He has also written a play in Big Finish's Sapphire and Steel range.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Guerrier's work is characterised by character-driven humour and by an interest in unifying the continuity of the various Big Finish ranges through multiple references and reappearances of characters. As editor he has been a strong promoter of the work of various script writers from the Seventh Doctor era of the Doctor Who television series&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="Key" Value="stephen-king" Type="String" />
      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;Stephen Edwin King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. After his parents separated when Stephen was a toddler, he and his older brother, David, were raised by his mother. Parts of his childhood were spent in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where his father's family was at the time, and in Stratford, Connecticut. When Stephen was eleven, his mother brought her children back to Durham, Maine, for good. Her parents, Guy and Nellie Pillsbury, had become incapacitated with old age, and Ruth King was persuaded by her sisters to take over the physical care of the elderly couple. Other family members provided a small house in Durham and financial support. After Stephen's grandparents passed away, Mrs. King found work in the kitchens of Pineland, a nearby residential facility for the mentally challenged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stephen attended the grammar school in Durham and then Lisbon Falls High School, graduating in 1966. From his sophomore year at the University of Maine at Orono, he wrote a weekly column for the school newspaper, THE MAINE CAMPUS. He was also active in student politics, serving as a member of the Student Senate. He came to support the anti-war movement on the Orono campus, arriving at his stance from a conservative view that the war in Vietnam was unconstitutional. He graduated from the University of Maine at Orono in 1970, with a B.A. in English and qualified to teach on the high school level. A draft board examination immediately post-graduation found him 4-F on grounds of high blood pressure, limited vision, flat feet, and punctured eardrums.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He and Tabitha Spruce married in January of 1971. He met Tabitha in the stacks of the Fogler Library at the University of Maine at Orono, where they both worked as students. As Stephen was unable to find placement as a teacher immediately, the Kings lived on his earnings as a laborer at an industrial laundry, and her student loan and savings, with an occasional boost from a short story sale to men's magazines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stephen made his first professional short story sale (&quot;The Glass Floor&quot;) to Startling Mystery Stories in 1967. Throughout the early years of his marriage, he continued to sell stories to men's magazines. Many of these were later gathered into the Night Shift collection or appeared in other anthologies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 1971, Stephen began teaching high school English classes at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in the evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories and to work on novels.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1973, Doubleday &amp;amp; Co. accepted the novel Carrie for publication. On Mother's Day of that year, Stephen learned from his new editor at Doubleday, Bill Thompson, that a major paperback sale would provide him with the means to leave teaching and write full-time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the summer of 1973, the Kings moved their growing family to southern Maine because of Stephen's mother's failing health. Renting a summer home on Sebago Lake in North Windham for the winter, Stephen wrote his next-published novel, originally titled Second Coming and then Jerusalem's Lot, before it became 'Salem's Lot, in a small room in the garage. During this period, Stephen's mother died of cancer, at the age of 59.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Carrie was published in the spring of 1974. That same fall, the Kings left Maine for Boulder, Colorado. They lived there for a little less than a year, during which Stephen wrote The Shining, set in Colorado. Returning to Maine in the summer of 1975, the Kings purchased a home in the Lakes Region of western Maine. At that house, Stephen finished writing The Stand, much of which also is set in Boulder. The Dead Zone was also written in Bridgton.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 1977, the Kings spent three months of a projected year-long stay in England, cut the sojourn short and returned home in mid-December, purchasing a new home in Center Lovell, Maine. After living there one summer, the Kings moved north to Orrington, near Bangor, so that Stephen could teach creative writing at the University of Maine at Orono. The Kings returned to Center Lovell in the spring of 1979. In 1980, the Kings purchased a second home in Bangor, retaining the Center Lovell house as a summer home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stephen and Tabitha now spend winters in Florida and the remainder of the year at their Bangor and Center Lovell homes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Kings have three children: Naomi Rachel, Joe Hill and Owen Phillip, and four grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stephen is of Scots-Irish ancestry, stands 6'4&quot; and weighs about 200 pounds. He is blue-eyed, fair-skinned, and has thick, black hair, with a frost of white most noticeable in his beard, which he sometimes wears between the end of the World Series and the opening of baseball spring training in Florida. Occasionally he wears a moustache in other seasons. He has worn glasses since he was a child.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He has put some of his college dramatic society experience to use doing cameos in several of the film adaptations of his works as well as a bit part in a George Romero picture, Knightriders. Joe Hill King also appeared in Creepshow, which was released in 1982. Stephen made his directorial debut, as well as writing the screenplay, for the movie Maximum Overdrive (an adaptation of his short story &quot;Trucks&quot;) in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stephen and Tabitha provide scholarships for local high school students and contribute to many other local and national charities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stephen is the 2003 recipient of The National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the 2014 National Medal of Arts.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;TED KOSMATKA set his sights early on being a writer. This mostly involved having all his writing rejected, pursuing a biology degree, dropping out before graduation, and becoming a steel worker like his father and grandfather. Then the mill went bankrupt. After that he worked various lab jobs where friendships were born and fire departments were called. (And where he learned the fine point of distinction between fire-resistant and fire-proof) Eventually, Ted ended up at a research lab. Then came the final logical step: ditching all that to write video games in Seattle. Ted&amp;rsquo;s fiction has been nominated for the Nebula and Sturgeon awards. His novel THE FLICKER MEN was selected by Publishers Weekly as one of the best thrillers of the summer.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="ShortBio" Value="&lt;p&gt;A recent interview that briefly sums it all up:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;After trying to find traditional success, love, and happiness by working in Corporate America for over a decade, marrying and divorcing young, and living in a condo with designer clothes and a sports car, Timber Hawkeye looked at his imported Italian furniture one day and realized Tyler Durden was right: the things you own end up owning you, and it&amp;rsquo;s not until you lose everything that you are free to do anything. So, Timber quit his job, sold everything he ever owned, and moved to Hawaii with just a backpack and the intention to live a simple and uncomplicated life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With nothing but newfound time on his hands, Timber simultaneously studied world religions and psychology to better understand what people believe and why we believe what we do. The journey that started with letting go of worldly possessions, quickly evolved into shedding outdated ideologies as well, old opinions, and emotional attachments. Before long, Timber found himself living in a Buddhist monastery, sitting in front of a Tibetan Lama, and saying, 'With all due respect, I don't believe the Buddha ever intended for his teachings to get THIS complicated!'&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the teacher looked around at all the statues of deities with multiple arms and chuckled, 'The Buddha didn't do this, Timber, the Tibetan culture did; this is their way. Why don't you try Zen? I think you would like it.'&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;True to form, Timber didn&amp;rsquo;t simply read a book about Zen Buddhism, he moved into a Zen monastery for the complete experience. Although it was certainly simpler, the teachings were still full of the dogma that sent him running from organized religion in the first place. The nagging question that changed everything for him was: why the monastic robes? Why not simply be the guy in town with the bright eyes? And today, that&amp;rsquo;s exactly who I met. In fact, when I asked Timber if he still considers himself a Buddhist, he said, 'I am many things, but not one of them defines me.'&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Timber was born Jewish, ordained Buddhist, uses a Hindu mantra, and his morning meditation is a Catholic prayer. His altar at home features a statue of Jesus, one of the Buddha, another of Saint Francis of Assisi, and they get along just fine. On paper, Timber Hawkeye is a bestselling author, a podcast producer, a publisher, and an international public speaker, but in person, he is just another friendly face in town.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hawkeye&amp;rsquo;s first book, Buddhist Boot Camp, is a collection of journal entries and letters from Hawaii that he had sent to friends over the course of eight years. Even though each chapter is only a page long, it beautifully shares a secular and non-sectarian approach to being at peace with the world (both within and around us). His follow-up memoir, Faithfully Religionless, offers an intimate glimpse into an extraordinary life filled with insight and motivation. In a nutshell, it&amp;rsquo;s about letting go of the need to know, the difference between feelings and emotions, the disparity between truths and facts, and the countless benefits of mindful living.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Timber&amp;rsquo;s books and the Buddhist Boot Camp Podcast invite us to lead a life of purpose, congruence, and conviction. His intention is to awaken, enlighten, enrich, and inspire, and I can vouch that reading his books has done exactly that, not just for me, but for thousands all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Read his books and listen to the Buddhist Boot Camp Podcast. You&amp;rsquo;ll be glad you did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="Content" Value="&lt;p&gt;In 1938, with the Japanese army approaching from Nanking, Huan Hsus great-great grandfather, Liu, and his five granddaughters, were forced to flee their hometown on the banks of the Yangtze River. But before they left a hole was dug as deep as a man, and as wide as a bedroom, in which was stowed the family heirlooms.The longer I looked at that red chrysanthemum plate, the more I wanted to touch it, feel its weight, and run my fingers over its edge, which, like its countrys and my familys history, was anything but smooth.1938. The Japanese army were fast approaching Xingang, the Yangtze River hometown of Huan Hsus great-great-grandfather, Liu. Along with his five granddaughters, Liu prepares to flee. Before they leave, they dig a hole and fill it to the brim with family heirlooms. Amongst their antique furniture, jade and scrolls, was Lius vast collection of prized antique porcelain.A decades-long flight across war-torn China splintered the family over thousands of miles. Grandfather Lius treasure remained buried along with a time that no one wished to speak of. And no one returned to find it until now.Huan Hsu, a journalist raised in America and armed only with curiosity, returned to China many years later. Wanting to learn more about not only his lost ancestral heirlooms but also porcelain itself, Hsu set out to separate the layers of fact and fiction that have obscured both China and his heritage and finally completed his familys long march back home.Melding memoir and travelogue with social and political history, The Porcelain Thief is an intimate and unforgettable way to understand the bloody, tragic and largely forgotten events that defined Chinese history in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune - and remarkable power - to whoever can unlock them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday&amp;rsquo;s riddles are based in the pop culture he loved - that of the late 20th century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday&amp;rsquo;s icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes&amp;rsquo;s oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt - among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life - and love - in the real world he&amp;rsquo;s always been so desperate to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A world at stake.&lt;br /&gt;A quest for the ultimate prize.&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hell Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

What's more, he died in a human vs. alien war which ended a whole century ago. But when he relives his traumatic final moments, he finds the spark to keep on living. That spark is vengeance. Trapped and desperate on a world surrounded by alien Prador forces, Spear had seen a rescue ship arriving. But instead of providing backup, Penny Royal, the AI within the destroyer turned rogue.

The Dark AI had triggered a transformation in Isobel that would turn her into a monster, rapidly evolving into something far from human.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spear hires Isobel to take him to the Penny Royal AI's last known whereabouts. But he cheats her in the process and he becomes a target for her vengeance. And as she is evolves further into a monstrous predator, rage soon wins over reason.

That's why this time traveler celebrates his birthday partying with himself. Every year, he travels to an abandoned hotel in New York City in 2071, the hundredth anniversary of his birth, and drinks twelve-year-old Scotch (lots of it) with all the other versions of who he has been and who he will be. Sure, the party is the same year after year, but at least it's one party where he can really, well, be himself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The year he turns 39, though, the party takes a stressful turn for the worse. Before he even makes it into the grand ballroom for a drink he encounters the body of his forty-year-old self, dead of a gunshot wound to the head. As the older versions of himself at the party point out, the onus is on him to figure out what went wrong--he has one year to stop himself from being murdered, or they're all goners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As he follows clues that he may or may not have willingly left for himself, he discovers rampant paranoia and suspicion among his younger selves, and a frightening conspiracy among the Elders. Most complicated of all is a haunting woman possibly named Lily who turns up at the party this year, the first person besides himself he's ever seen at the party. For the first time, he has something to lose. Here's hoping he can save some version of his own life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

Branded as terrorists, the Guardians and their leader, Bradley Johansson, have been hunted by relentless investigator Paula Myo. But now evidence suggests that the Guardians were right all along, and that the Starflyer has placed agents in vital posts throughout the Commonwealth -- agents who are now sabotaging the war effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is the Starflyer an ally of the Prime, or has it orchestrated a fight to the death between the two species for its own advantage?

It does not collapse into a black hole. It simply disappears. Since the location is too distant to reach by wormhole, a faster-than-light starship, the Second Chance, is dispatched to learn what has occurred and whether it represents a threat. In command is Wilson Kime, a five-time rejuvenated ex-NASA pilot whose glory days are centuries behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Opposed to the mission are the Guardians of Selfhood, a cult that believes the human race is being manipulated by an alien entity they call the Starflyer. Bradley Johansson, leader of the Guardians, warns of sabotage, fearing the Starflyer means to use the starship's mission for its own ends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pursued by a Commonwealth special agent convinced the Guardians are crazy but dangerous, Johansson flees. But the danger is not averted. Aboard the Second Chance, Kime wonders if his crew has been infiltrated. Soon enough, he will have other worries.

For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune - and remarkable power - to whoever can unlock them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday&amp;rsquo;s riddles are based in the pop culture he loved - that of the late 20th century.

Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes&amp;rsquo;s oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt - among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life - and love - in the real world he&amp;rsquo;s always been so desperate to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A world at stake.&lt;br /&gt;A quest for the ultimate prize.&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready?&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="Content" Value="&lt;p&gt;Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes The Pillars of the Earth extraordinary is the time the twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and the monasteries become a familiar landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each character is brought vividly to life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The building of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a king.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

Franzen brings an old-time America of freight trains and civic duty, of Cub Scouts and Christmas cookies and sexual inhibitions, into brilliant collision with the modern absurdities of brain science, home surveillance, hands-off parenting, do-it-yourself mental healthcare, and the anti-gravity New Economy.

Although she would never admit it to her neighbors or her three grown children, her husband, Alfred, is losing his grip on reality. Maybe it's the medication that Alfred takes for his Parkinson's disease, or maybe it's his negative attitude, but he spends his days brooding in the basement and committing shadowy, unspeakable acts.

Most records of their journeys were destroyed. Lost in China's long, self-imposed isolation that followed was the knowledge that Chinese ships had reached America 70 years before Columbus &amp;amp; had circumnavigated the globe a century before Magellan. Also concealed was how the Chinese colonized America before the Europeans &amp;amp; transplanted in America &amp;amp; other countries the principal economic crops that have fed &amp;amp; clothed the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unveiling incontrovertible evidence of these astonishing voyages, &quot;1421&quot; rewrites our understanding of history.

Any oil that remains usable is more prized than ever. No one can build solar farms, wind farms, and electric cars quickly enough to cope. The few countries still able to export oil and natural gas&amp;mdash;Russia chief among them&amp;mdash;have a stranglehold on the world economy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then, from the darkness of space, came Phoebe. Rather than divert the onrushing asteroid, America captured it in Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Solar power satellites&amp;mdash;cheaply mass-produced in orbit with resources mined from the new moon to beam vast amounts of power to the ground&amp;mdash;offer America its last, best hope of avoiding servitude and economic ruin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As though building miles-across structures in space isn't challenging enough, special interests, from technophobes to eco-extremists to radio astronomers, want to stop the project. And the remaining petro powers will do anything to protect their newfound dominance of world affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;NASA engineer Marcus Judson is determined to make the powersat demonstration project a success. And he will&amp;mdash;even though nothing in his job description mentions combating an international cabal, or going into space to do it.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune - and remarkable power - to whoever can unlock them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday&amp;rsquo;s riddles are based in the pop culture he loved - that of the late 20th century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday&amp;rsquo;s icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes&amp;rsquo;s oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt - among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life - and love - in the real world he&amp;rsquo;s always been so desperate to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A world at stake.&lt;br /&gt;A quest for the ultimate prize.&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready?&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="Content" Value="&lt;p&gt;Halo: Cryptum, the first novel in the Forerunner Saga trilogy by science fiction legend Greg Bear, is set in the Halo universe and based on the New York Times bestselling video game series! It is a tale of life, death, intergalactic horror, exile, and maturity...a story of overwhelming change, and of human origins; For the Mantle may not lie upon the shoulders of Forerunners forever. 100,000 years ago, the galaxy was populated by a great variety of beings. But one species--eons beyond all others in both technology and knowledge--achieved dominance. They ruled in peace but met opposition with quick and brutal effectiveness. They were the Forerunners, the keepers of the Mantle, the next stage of life in the Universe's Living Time. And then they vanished. This is their story. Bornstellar Makes Eternal Lasting is a young rebellious Forerunner. He is a Manipular, untried, yet to become part of the adult Forerunner society, where vast knowledge and duty waits. He comes from a family of Builders, the Forerunners' highest and most politically powerful rate. It is the Builders who create the grand technology that facilitates Forerunner dominance over the known universe. It is the Builders who believe they must shoulder the greatest burden of the Mantle, as shepherds and guardians of all life. Bornstellar is marked to become a great Builder just like his father. But this Manipular has other plans. He is obsessed with lost treasures of the past. His reckless passion to seek out the marvelous artifacts left behind by the Precursors, long-vanished superbeings of unknowable power and intent, forces his father's hand. Bornstellar is sent to live among the Miners, where he must come to terms with where his duty truly lies. But powerful forces are at play. Forerunner society is at a major crux. Past threats are once again proving relentless. Dire solutions, machines and strategies never before contemplated, are being called up, and fissures in Forerunner power are leading to chaos. On a Lifeworker's experimental planet, Bornstellar's rebellious course crosses the paths of two humans, and the long lifeline of a great military leader, thus forever changing Bornstellar's destiny ...and the fate of the entire galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

Huge fleets of sentient trader starships thrive on the wealth created by the industrialization of entire star systems. And throughout inhabited space the Confederation Navy keeps the peace. A true golden age is within our grasp.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But now something has gone catastrophically wrong. On a primitive colony planet a renegade criminal's chance encounter with an utterly alien entity unleashes the most primal of all our fears. An extinct race which inhabited the galaxy aeons ago called it &quot;The Reality Dysfunction.&quot; It is the nightmare which has prowled beside us since the beginning of history.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

Now he needs to pull together the struggling Hellhole colony, the ever-expanding shadow-Xayan settlement, and his connections with the other Deep Zone worlds. Even then, he doubts his desperate measures will be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Diadem Michella Duchenet has collected a huge space fleet led by Commodore Escobar Hallholme, son of the hero who originally defeated Adolphus. They expect resistance from the General's rebels, but who could possibly stand up to such a mighty fleet?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adolphus knows he's running out of time, but he still has some hope--the shadow-Xayans have banded together to defend their sacred planet with &quot;telemancy,&quot; but can they discover new powers to protect all the stored alien lives on the already devastated world? And when all hope seems lost, the awakened Xayans reveal information hidden even from their own followers--the existence of a bigger threat that makes even the Constellation fleet seem insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disaster has come for General Adolphus and Hellhole...and this time there is no escape.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

His first novel in ten years is the hilarious and tragic portrait of an orphaned Indian boy who travels back and forth through time in a charged search for his true identity. With powerful and swift, prose, Flight follows this troubled foster teenager--a boy who is not a &quot;legal&quot; Indian because he was never claimed by his father--as he learns that violence is not the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The journey for Flight's young hero begins as he's about to commit a massive act o violence. At the moment of decision, he finds himself shot back through time to resurface in the body of an FBI agent during the civil rights era, where he sees why &quot;Hell is Re driver, Idaho, in the 1970s.&quot; Red River is only the first stop in an eye-opening trip through moments in American history. He will continue traveling back to inhabit the body of an Indian child during the battle at Little Bighorn and then ride with an Indian tracker in the nineteenth century before materializing as an airline pilot jetting through the skies today. During these furious travels through time, his refrain grows: &quot;Who's to judge?&quot; and &quot;I don't understand humans.&quot; When finally, blessedly, our young warrior comes to rest again in his own life, he is mightily transformed by all he has seen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is Sherman Alexie at his most brilliant--making us laugh while he's breaking our hearts. Time Out has said that &quot;Alexie, like his characters, is on a modern-day vision quest,&quot; and in Flight he seeks nothing less than an understanding of why human beings hate. Flight is irrepressible, fearless, and groundbreaking Alexie.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

His first novel in ten years is the hilarious and tragic portrait of an orphaned Indian boy who travels back and forth through time in a charged search for his true identity. With powerful and swift, prose, Flight follows this troubled foster teenager--a boy who is not a &quot;legal&quot; Indian because he was never claimed by his father--as he learns that violence is not the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The journey for Flight's young hero begins as he's about to commit a massive act o violence. At the moment of decision, he finds himself shot back through time to resurface in the body of an FBI agent during the civil rights era, where he sees why &quot;Hell is Re driver, Idaho, in the 1970s.&quot; Red River is only the first stop in an eye-opening trip through moments in American history. He will continue traveling back to inhabit the body of an Indian child during the battle at Little Bighorn and then ride with an Indian tracker in the nineteenth century before materializing as an airline pilot jetting through the skies today. During these furious travels through time, his refrain grows: &quot;Who's to judge?&quot; and &quot;I don't understand humans.&quot; When finally, blessedly, our young warrior comes to rest again in his own life, he is mightily transformed by all he has seen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is Sherman Alexie at his most brilliant--making us laugh while he's breaking our hearts. Time Out has said that &quot;Alexie, like his characters, is on a modern-day vision quest,&quot; and in Flight he seeks nothing less than an understanding of why human beings hate. Flight is irrepressible, fearless, and groundbreaking Alexie.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

Estranged from his wife and adult daughter, he spends his days and nights lost in translation -- constantly working and reworking the riddles inscribed on ancient funereal stones. A gifted American Egyptologist, he was hired by the British Museum in London to try to crack the code of one of the greatest remaining hieroglyphic mysteries -- the Stela of Paser. Stuck, with no new inspiration, he meets a seductive young woman who seems interested in him and his work. When Walter invites her back to the museum to get a closer look at his work, she secretly steals an antiquity and disappears. Thus begins Walter's frantic search to repair the damage he's caused. Threatened by villains real and imagined, Walter races against time to win back the antiquity and his reputation, without losing his life in the process. Utterly original and told in electric prose, this is a novel that beautifully weaves together exceptional insight into the inner yearnings of men with a fast-paced plot about ancient mystery and modern conspiracy.

Chase owes his current social cachet to an ongoing tragedy much covered in the tabloids: His teenage sweetheart and fianc&amp;eacute;e, Janice Trumbull, is trapped by a layer of low-orbit mines on the International Space Station, from which she sends him rapturous and heartbreaking love letters.

Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, &quot;By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it?

A ship that had headed to Earth with a mission and a message: Help Us. A brave new frontier beckons. But we are about to learn that it comes with a price...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without warning, the aliens transport small groups of humans from the competing scientific communities of Houston, Texas and Bangalore, India to the vast interior habitats of Keanu. Their first challenge is to survive. Their second; to discover why The Architects&amp;mdash;the unknown, unseen aliens controlling the asteroid&amp;mdash;brought them there. And soon a third emerges: they must find a way to take control of Keanu.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because the NEO is moving again&amp;mdash;away from Earth.

While the cause of death is clear, the officer's identity is not. With nerve ends raw from the media focus on recent scandals, the Pentagon bypasses its own investigative service and appoints a commander, Dan Collins, and a civilian, Grace Snow, to conduct an inquiry.

Soon he finds himself looking for his wife as well in a netherworld that lies beneath the placid surface of Tokyo. As these searches intersect, Okada encounters a bizarre group of allies and antagonists: a psychic prostitute; a malevolent yet mediagenic politician; a cheerfully morbid sixteen-year-old-girl; and an aging war veteran who has been permanently changed by the hideous things he witnessed during Japan's forgotten campaign in Manchuria.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Gripping, prophetic, suffused with comedy and menace, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is a tour de force equal in scope to the masterpieces of Mishima and Pynchon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three books in one volume: The Thieving Magpie, Bird as Prophet, The Birdcatcher.

      <Value Key="Content" Value="&lt;p&gt;In his most recent New York Times bestselling book, The Great Depression Ahead, Harry S. Dent, Jr., predicted that the stimulus plan created in response to the first crisis would hit demographic and debt saturation headwinds and ultimately fail. In 2010, the stimulus plan had started to fail, and it was already stalling by the first quarter of 2011. The Great Crash Ahead outlines why the next crash and crisis is inevitable, and just around the corner&amp;mdash;coming between 2012 and 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With incisive critical analysis and historical examples, this book lays bare the traditional assumptions of economics. Dent shows that the government doesn&amp;rsquo;t drive our economy, consumers and businesses do; that the Fed does not create most of the money in our economy, the private banking system does; and that the largest generation in history is now saving for or moving into retirement, meaning slowing growth. This is the new normal! Our banking system borrowed to lend for the first time in history with unprecedented leverage and debt levels of $42 trillion, way beyond the massive government debt. But the government&amp;rsquo;s promises and unfunded liabilities take the cake, at an estimated $66 trillion and growing!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These massive debts will have to be restructured in a time of slowing spending, and this means a deflationary crisis, which is very different from the inflationary crisis of the 1970s and requires very different personal, investment, and business strategies. Dent and Johnson outline these strategies in very practical detail. In the coming years, the greatest surprise will be that the U.S. dollar becomes the safe haven and appreciates just when everyone is calling for it to crash, while the gold and silver bubbles burst along with the stock and commodity bubbles. And real estate will see another round of declines just when everyone thought it could go no lower. The Great Crash Ahead is about making smart, cautious investments&amp;mdash;avoiding the sort of high-risk, high-profit investment schemes that sank the world economy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The road to recovery will be filled with challenges and will require massive change, such as debt restructuring, plans for greater employment, the restructuring of social welfare programs such as social security and health care, budget cuts, and higher taxes&amp;mdash;in short, a revision of the kind of lifestyle that characterized the &amp;ldquo;Roaring 2000s.&amp;rdquo; The good news is this process will eliminate tens of trillions of dollars of debt and can make way for growth again as the echo boom generation ascends. Or we can continue on our present course and end up like the Japanese, with no growth and high debt two decades later.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

A powerful destiny waiting to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Monsoon is the sweeping epic that continues the saga begun in Wilbur Smith's bestselling Birds of Prey. Once a voracious adventurer, it has been many years since Hal Courtney has dared the high seas. Now he must return with three of his sons - Tom, Dorian, and Guy - to protect the East India Trading Company from looting pirates, in exchange for half of the fortune he recovers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will be a death or glory mission in the name of the crown. But Hal must also think about the fates of his sons. Like their father before them, Tom, Dorian, and Guy are drawn inexorably to Africa. When fate decrees that they must all leave England forever, they set said for the dark, unexplored continent, seduced by the allure and mystery of this new, magnificent, but savage land. All will have a crucial part to play in shaping the Courtneys' destiny, as the family vies for a prize beyond any of their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a story of anger and passion, peace and war, Wilbur Smith evinces himself at the height of his storytelling powers. Set at the dawn of eighteenth-century England, with the Courtneys riding wind-tossed seas toward Arabia and Africa, Monsoon is an exhilarating adventure pitting brother against brother, man against sea, and good against evil.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="Content" Value="&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed financial journalist Eric J. Weiner reveals how foreign countries and private investors are increasingly controlling the global economy and secretly wresting power from the United States in ways that our government cannot reverse and about which the average American knows nothing.The most potent force in global commerce today is not the Federal Reserve, not the international banks, not the governments of the G7 countries, and certainly not the European Union. Rather, it is the multi-trillion-dollar network of super-rich, secretive, and largely unregulated investment vehicles&amp;mdash;foreign sovereign wealth funds, government-run corporations, private equity funds, and hedge funds&amp;mdash;that are quietly buying up the world, piece by valuable piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Weiner&amp;rsquo;s groundbreaking account shows, the shadow market doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a physical headquarters such as Wall Street. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a formal leadership or an index to track or a single zone of exchange.

      <Value Key="Teaser" Value="&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed financial journalist Eric J. Weiner reveals how foreign countries and private investors are increasingly controlling the global economy and secretly wresting power from the United States in ways that our government cannot reverse and about which the average American knows nothing.The most potent force in global commerce today is not the Federal Reserve, not the international banks, not the governments of the G7 countries, and certainly not the European Union. Rather, it is the multi-trillion-dollar network of super-rich, secretive, and largely unregulated investment vehicles&amp;mdash;foreign sovereign wealth funds, government-run corporations, private equity funds, and hedge funds&amp;mdash;that are quietly buying up the world, piece by valuable piece.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As Weiner&amp;rsquo;s groundbreaking account shows, the shadow market doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a physical headquarters such as Wall Street. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a formal leadership or an index to track or a single zone of exchange. Rather, it comprises an invisible and ever-shifting global nexus where money mixes with geopolitical power, often with great speed and secrecy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Led by cash-flush nations such as China, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, and even Norway, the shadow market is hiring the brightest international financial talent money can buy and is now assembling the gigantic investment portfolios that will form the power structure of tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s economy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of the Great Recession and subsequent liquidity problems in the United States and Europe, the major players of the shadow market are deploying staggering amounts of cash, controlling the capital markets, and securing not only major stakes in multinational companies but huge tracts of farmland and natural resources across the world.

When the government refuses to either rescue him or negotiate for his release, Belknap decides to take matters into his own hands.Meanwhile, hedge fund analyst Andrea Bancroft gets a surprising call - she is to receive an unexpected bequest of six million dollars from a cousin she never met. With one condition -- she must agree to sit on the board of the Bancroft family foundation, a charitable organization that is run by the family patriarch, Paul Newton. Having never been involved with, or even met, the family - her mother was briefly married to an Bancroft and cut off all contact many years ago - Andrea is intrigued. But the foundation, which is dedicated to doing strategic good deeds, appears less and less benign the more deeply involved she gets. What exactly is their involvement with the &quot;Genesis&quot; - a mysterious group working to destabilize the geopolitical balance at the risk of millions of lives?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As events escalate, Todd Belknap and Andrea Bancroft come together and must form an uneasy alliance if they are to uncover the truth behind &quot;Genesis&quot; -- before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

But after arriving in the body of a willing human sacrifice instead of a Mayan king, Jed&amp;rsquo;s experiences led him to the fateful decision that rather than avert the apocalypse, he must ensure instead that the world ends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using his knowledge of the divination game, Jed sets in motion a series of events that will bring about the destruction of humanity, ending the world&amp;rsquo;s pain and suffering once and for all. But before the plan can be completed, the organization that sent him into the past discovers his intention and devotes every resource to stop him.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Taking readers back to the dizzying action of ancient times, The Sacrifice Game is a breathtaking odyssey in which Jed must survive bloody wars, ruthless leaders, shifting alliances, and unspeakable betrayal to learn about the Game, before his time in both the ancient Mayan empire and the present day runs out.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

So when the Hegemony Survey Force encountered a world whose so-called &quot;sentients&quot; &quot;humans,&quot; they called themselves&amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;rdquo;were almost as bad as the Shongairi themselves, it seemed reasonable to use the Shongairi to neutralize them before they could become a second threat to galactic peace.

When a homeless man meets a similarly gruesome  and mystifying  fate, the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta sends pathologist Alice Austen to investigate.

The race is on, and Lourds' challengers will do anything to get there first.Whoever controls the Lost Continent will control the world.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

In the losing, hopeless struggle against Daybreak, Heather O'Grainne played a major role. That story was told in Directive 51.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now Heather's story continues in Daybreak Zero. In the summer of 2025, she leads a tiny organization of scientists, spies, scouts, entrepreneurs, engineers, dreamers, and daredevils based in Pueblo, Colorado. Both of the almost-warring governments of the United States have charged them with an all but impossible mission: find a way to put the world back together.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Daybreak's triumph has flung the world back centuries in technology, politics, and culture.

Her agents have exceptional courage, initiative, skill, intelligence, and daring, but can they be enough?

For somewhere inside this giant networked playground, OASIS creator James Halliday has hidden a series of fiendish puzzles that will yield massive fortune - and remarkable power - to whoever can unlock them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For years, millions have struggled fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that Halliday&amp;rsquo;s riddles are based in the pop culture he loved - that of the late 20th century. And for years, millions have found in this quest another means of escape, retreating into happy, obsessive study of Halliday&amp;rsquo;s icons. Like many of his contemporaries, Wade is as comfortable debating the finer points of John Hughes&amp;rsquo;s oeuvre, playing Pac-Man, or reciting Devo lyrics as he is scrounging power to run his OASIS rig.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then Wade stumbles upon the first puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly the whole world is watching, and thousands of competitors join the hunt - among them certain powerful players who are willing to commit very real murder to beat Wade to this prize. Now the only way for Wade to survive and preserve everything he knows is to win. But to do so, he may have to leave behind his oh-so-perfect virtual existence and face up to life - and love - in the real world he&amp;rsquo;s always been so desperate to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A world at stake.&lt;br /&gt;A quest for the ultimate prize.&lt;br /&gt;Are you ready?&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="Content" Value="&lt;p&gt;Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

But, ironically, so was my later journey to God.' - Lee Strobel&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During his academic years, Lee Strobel became convinced that God was outmoded, a belief that colored his ensuing career as an award-winning journalist at the Chicago Tribune. Science had made the idea of a Creator irrelevant - or so Strobel thought. But today science is pointing in a different direction. In recent years, a diverse and impressive body of research has increasingly supported the conclusion that the universe was intelligently designed. At the same time, Darwinism has faltered in the face of concrete facts and hard reason.Has science discovered God? At the very least, it's giving faith an immense boost as new findings emerge about the incredible complexity of our universe. Join Strobel as he re-examines the theories that once led him away from God. Through his compelling and highly readable account, you'll encounter the mind-stretching discoveries from cosmology, cellular biology, DNA research, astronomy, physics, and human consciousness that present astonishing evidence in The Case for a Creator.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />

      <Value Key="Content" Value="&lt;p&gt;The New International Version (NIV) is a completely original translation of the Bible developed by more than one hundred scholars working from the best available Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek texts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The initial vision for the project was provided by a single individual &amp;ndash; an engineer working with General Electric in Seattle by the name of Howard Long. Long was a lifelong devotee of the King James Version, but when he shared it with his friends he was distressed to find that it just didn&amp;rsquo;t connect. Long saw the need for a translation that captured the truths he loved in the language that his contemporaries spoke.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For 10 years, Long and a growing group of like-minded supporters drove this idea. The passion of one man became the passion of a church, and ultimately the passion of a whole group of denominations. And finally, in 1965, after several years of preparatory study, a trans-denominational and international group of scholars met in Palos Heights, Illinois, and agreed to begin work on the project &amp;ndash; determining to not simply adapt an existing English version of the Bible but to start from scratch with the best available manuscripts in the original languages. Their conclusion was endorsed by a large number of church leaders who met in Chicago in 1966.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A self-governing body of fifteen biblical scholars, the Committee on Bible Translation (CBT) was formed and charged with responsibility for the version, and in 1968 the New York Bible Society (which subsequently became the International Bible Society and then Biblica) generously undertook the financial sponsorship of the project. The translation of each book was assigned to translation teams, each made up of two lead translators, two translation consultants, and a stylistic consultant where necessary. The initial translations produced by these teams were carefully scrutinized and revised by intermediate editorial committees of five biblical scholars to check them against the source texts and assess them for comprehensibility. Each edited text was then submitted to a general committee of eight to twelve members before being distributed to selected outside critics and to all members of the CBT in preparation for a final review. Samples of the translation were tested for clarity and ease of reading with pastors, students, scholars, and lay people across the full breadth of the intended audience. Perhaps no other translation has undergone a more thorough process of review and revision. From the very start, the NIV sought to bring modern Bible readers as close as possible to the experience of the very first Bible readers: providing the best possible blend of transparency to the original documents and comprehension of the original meaning in every verse. With this clarity of focus, however, came the realization that the work of translating the NIV would never be truly complete. As new discoveries were made about the biblical world and its languages, and as the norms of English usage developed and changed over time, the NIV would also need to change to hold true to its original vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And so in the original NIV charter, provision was made not just to issue periodic updates to the text but also to create a mechanism for constant monitoring of changes in biblical scholarship and English usage. The CBT was charged to meet every year to review, maintain, and strengthen the NIV&amp;rsquo;s ability to accurately and faithfully render God&amp;rsquo;s unchanging Word in modern English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 2011 update to the NIV is the latest fruit of this process. By working with input from pastors and Bible scholars, by grappling with the latest discoveries about biblical languages and the biblical world, and by using cutting-edge research on English usage, the Committee on Bible Translation has updated the text to ensure that the New International Version of the Bible remains faithful to Howard Long&amp;rsquo;s original inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;" Type="String" />
